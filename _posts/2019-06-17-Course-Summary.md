Throughout taking this course, my growth as a historian has been an interesting journey. I originally took this course with no prior history knowledge and wanted to see and learn the technology related aspect that was offered in this course. I eventually did learn about the technological aspect of this course but also learned about the struggles that historians must deal with.  Issues such as sometime being unable to share research  notes with other colleagues and having to efficiently clean through data. Despite this the experience of this course has been rewarding as it has taught me that the past can still hold information that we may not know about. Interesting things I learned in this course such as OCR, cleaning data and analyzing data.  Using the Tesseract OCR to convert images to text files was very memorable since I never used an OCR before but despite its lack of accuracy for reading handwriting , it is still very useful. Cleaning data was the hardest part in this course especially with the war diaries, I used Openrefine and such, but the data was still messy and required me to manually fix each text file. The different tools that can be used to analyze for patterns in the data was probably the most versatile exercise since it allows you to interpret the data in different ways.

The greatest weakness I have faced in this course would be underestimating the length of the modules. Some modules in this course at first did not seem troubling at all but when going through the material I started to realize how lengthy the material is. Due to underestimating the complexity of these modules, I then began to attempt to rush through them which results in me making more mistakes and resulting in taking more time to complete the exercises. My greatest strength in this course was that I had a good background on a lot of computer technical  related exercises  such as using command line.  Despite this I did have some technical related problems such as installing programs on through the command line, but I was able to quickly resolve them. 

Overall these past couple of weeks of taking this course it has been rewarding and difficult at the same. This course taught me how to research and analyze data much better and I feel like it would be a very asset towards my future endeavors.
